## Conditional Statements in Python: Even or Odd Checker
## AIM
 To write a Python program to check whether the given number is even or odd using if...else statements.
## ALGORITHM
1. Get an input from the user.
2. Convert the input to an integer and store it in a variable a .
3. Use the modulo operator % to check if a % 2 == 0 .
  - If true, print "EVEN" .
  - Else, print "ODD" .
4. End the program.
## PROGRAM
```
num=int(input())
 if(num%2==0):
 print("Even")
 else:
 print("Odd")
```

## Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python
## AIM
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving True and False.
## ALGORITHM
 1. Set variable a to the result of the expression 0 == True .
 2. Set variable b to the result of the expression False == False .
 3. Set variable c to the result of the expression True + True .
 4. Set variable d to the result of the expression False + 9 .
 5. Print the value of a with the label "a is".
 6. Print the value of b with the label "b is".
 7. Print the value of c with the label "c:".
 8. Print the value of d with the label "d:".
## PROGRAM
```
a = (0 == True)
 b = (False== False)
 c = True + True
î·›
 d = False + 9
 print('a is',a)
 print('b is',b)
 print('c:',c)
 print('d:',d)
```

## Datatypes-Character Literal in Python
## AIM
To write a Python program that prints the characters 'T' and 'a' using character literals.
## ALGORITHM
1. Print the character 'T' .
2. Print the character 'a' .
## PROGRAM
```
 v='T'
 b='a'
 print(v)
 print(b)
```
## OUTPUT

## RESULT
Thus, the program is executed sucessfully.


## Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python
## AIM
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the
complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.
## ALGORITHM
 1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable a (real part).
 2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable b (imaginary part).
 3. Create a complex number x using the complex(a, b) function.
 4. Print the complex number x.
 5. Print the real part of x using x.real.
 6. Print the imaginary part of x using x.imag.
## PROGRAM
```
x=int(input(''))
 y=int(input(''))
 x=complex(x,y)
 print(x)
 print(x.real)
 print(x.imag)
```
## OUTPUT

## RESULT
Thus, the program as been executed successfully.

## Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python
## AIM
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.
## ALGORITHM
 1. Assign a variable named men_stepped_on_the_moon.
 2. Use input() to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
 3. Print the value stored in the variable.
## PROGRAM
```
men_stepped_on_the_moon=input()
 print(men_stepped_on_the_moon)
```
## OUTPUT
